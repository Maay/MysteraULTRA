# MysteraPlus
Chrome extension for Mystera Legacy

#### Exploration
Click the green GO icon to start vertical pacing to train exploration. You'll will pace as far up and down as your character is able, so maybe don't use this outside. The game must be in the active tab for this to work. If you would like to browse the web while using this feature, just move Mystera's tab to a new window.

#### Auto-attack
Press F1 to toggle your attack. Beware that graphics are not rendered while the window is in the background, so they will be rendered all at once when you return. This may render your game frozen for several seconds. Switch back to the game frequently to prevent it.

**These features will not prevent you from using the in-game chat.**

#### Compass
Press F2 to see your position. No compass required.

#### Durability alert
A sound effect will be triggered when one of your items hits 25% durability. This is so that you don't afk your items away.

#### Disconnections
The extension will attempt to reconnect you in the event of a disconnect so that you don't have to reload the page.

## Installation

Because this isn't on the chrome web store, you'll need to install it manually. First, download the zip by clicking "Clone or download" and then "Download ZIP" and extract it somewhere. Then open the settings menu in chrome and open the extensions tab. Click the check box to enable developer mode, then click "Load unpacked extension" and select the folder you extracted to. You'll need to reload the game for it to work properly.
